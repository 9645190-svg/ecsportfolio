<p>My interest is in music, but especially playing the guitar and singing. I have been playing for about 4 years now and am still learning so much. I am the only one in my family that plays guitar and sings. I make an effort to practice daily and have been moving on to learning advanced songs that require lead guitar picking styles and the more excessive use of bar chords.</p> 
	  <p>Timeline:</p>
	  <p>2021-I started playing guitar. I started off playing acoustic, and learning simple songs.</p>
	  <p>June 8, 2023- I preformed in front of a live audience for the first time. I was at a camp called FSY, and they were holding a show during that week to show off talents and skills, which I decided to enter playing guitar while singing. I preformed the popular song Riptide, sung by Vance Joy.</p>
      <p>November 13, 2023- I preformed my second time at a talent show for my middle school, Olympus Junior High. I decided on playing Roar by Katy Perry.</p>
