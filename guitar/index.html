<p>My interest is in music, but especially playing the guitar and singing. I have been playing for about 4 years now and am still learning so much. I am the only one in my family that plays guitar and sings. I make an effort to practice daily and have been moving on to learning advanced songs that require lead guitar picking styles and the more excessive use of bar chords.</p>
